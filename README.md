# Love Running

Dublin Boxing Accademy is a project aiming to help people get fit while having fun, giving them the option of boxing or boxercise. It's giving everyone the opportunity to build self confidence and make new friends. The site will be targeted towards users who have a keen interest in fitness or want to learn boxing. The site shows the times and different class per day. 

## Features 

Navigation bar shows; Home, Who are we and sign up. It also has a comment the home of champions.

The landing page has a nice picture of people doing boxing and has links to the social media in the footer.
The about page shows a paragraph of who we are, a picture of boxing, our classes and our contact details.
The sign up page, lets us sign up to the classes and asks for basic information.

### Features Left to Implement
None, I've done the features.

## Testing 

While testing, I got so many bugs especialy with the sign up page. The site now works on many different screen sizes, used dev tools to help with this!




### Validator Testing 

On the W3C Validator it shows that my charset is incorrect.
Couldn't use the jigsaw validator due to it showing error 503 when I click the page.


### Unfixed Bugs

The meta charset from the validator, it keeps saying the same thing.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub.
Live site is here; 


## Credits 

My site I used some external help, such as favicon from the Love running as any favicon I used wouldn't work.
I got my layout similiar to the love running, and used the love running sign up sheet but changed it around and added some extra. My pictures I got from the internet. I want to give a huge credit to The code institute for the understanding that my laptop broke during this project and extended my leave of absence until I got paid to buy a new one. After the leave of absence Codeanywhere was down for some time.


### Content 

The content written by me was from my own doing, The address is the only thing thhat isnt mine whicchh is Flyfit IFSC.

### Media

The Photos are from the internet, as most sites either wouldnt work or had to pay for them.
